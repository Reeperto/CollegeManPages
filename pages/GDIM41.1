.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
Video games are an important artistic, cultural, and entertainment
medium of the 21st century.
They entertain, educate, inspire, concern, and confound.
Today, two thirds of adults and three quarters of youth under the age of
18 play videogames weekly (ESA, 2021).
But games are not merely popular; they are culturally, socially, and
intellectually important as well.
In this course, through the lens of five game titles, we examine how
games are defined and their key elements, theories of games and play,
game culture, and the import for society.
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Critically analyze, describe, and discuss games as part of culture and society using key concepts and theories from class
Produce written, oral, and visual communication that clearly expresses a point of view or thesis and its rationale or justification.
Understand, explain, and critically evaluate the basic modes of inquiry used in the social sciences including experimental, survey, qualitative, ethnographic, and interpretive methods.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In order to accomplish this, students will read academic texts about
games (both primary and secondary), play selected game titles, write
expository and persuasive text about their gameplay and important issues
related to it, and participate actively in lecture and discussion.
This class is open to everyone, from students who have never before a
game to enthusiasts and game design majors.

\f[B]Gameplay:\f[R] Each two-week unit focuses on a different game
title, which you will be expected to play throughout the unit.
We will not grade your gameplay but we will grade your assignments which
are based on it, so we expect you to keep pace with class each unit and
play (not merely watch) the games assigned.
.PP
\f[B]Engaged Reading:\f[R] Each class, you will actively and
collaboratively read and annotate assigned articles in Perusall, which
is linked directly to the Canvas site.
The quality, quantity, and timeliness of your text annotations and peer
comments will be reviewed and graded.
.PP
\f[B]Homework Assignments:\f[R] Each week you will complete an
individual homework assignment that connects ideas from the lectures and
readings to the game played.
Detailed instructions and a grading rubric for each homework assignment
is available on Canvas.
.PP
\f[B]Unit Assignments:\f[R] As part of each unit, you will complete a
group project demonstrating your understanding of the unit\[cq]s course
content.

be made available on Canvas.
.PP
\f[B]Peer Evaluation of Group Work Contribution:\f[R] As part of each
unit assignment, your group member peers will evaluate your individual
contribution, communication, and attitude; such peer evaluations will
contribute to your final grade.

.SH ACADEMIC HONESTY
.PP
Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is academic fraud.
You plagiarize when, without proper attribution, you do any of the
following: copy verbatim from a book, an article, or other media;
download documents from the Internet; purchase documents; report from
other\[cq]s oral work; paraphrase or restate someone else\[cq]s facts,
analysis, and/or conclusions; or copy directly from a classmate or allow
a classmate to copy from you.
If you are in doubt about what lies within the bounds of honest work,
come see me before turning in your assignment.
Any instances of academic dishonesty will result in an F for the course
and a letter that will go into your academic file at UCI.

.SH INCLUSIVE CLASSROOM POLICY

As your instructors, we are committed to ensuring equality and valuing
diversity throughout our course.

religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic
backgrounds, regions, and nationalities are strongly encouraged to share
their rich array of perspectives and experiences.
If you feel your differences may in some way isolate you from UCI\[cq]s
community or if you have a need for any specific accommodations, please
speak with us early in the quarter about your concerns and what we can
do together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class
and community.

.SH LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
.PP
This UC Irvine campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and
unceded territory of the Acjachemen and Tongva peoples, including 86
sacred sites and burial grounds.
Both tribes continue to act as stewards of their ancestral lands as they
have for over 8000 years.
Settler colonialism is not a historical event but a current, ongoing
process of thievery and extermination that indigenous people continue to
resist to this very day.

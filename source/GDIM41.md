# SYNOPSIS
Video games are an important artistic, cultural, and entertainment medium of the 21st century. They entertain, educate, inspire, concern, and confound. Today, two thirds of adults and three quarters of youth under the age of 18 play videogames weekly (ESA, 2021). But games are not merely popular; they are culturally, socially, and intellectually important as well. In this course, through the lens of five game titles, we examine how games are defined and their key elements, theories of games and play, game culture, and the import for society. By the end of this course, students will be able to:

    Critically analyze, describe, and discuss games as part of culture and society using key concepts and theories from class
    Produce written, oral, and visual communication that clearly expresses a point of view or thesis and its rationale or justification.
    Understand, explain, and critically evaluate the basic modes of inquiry used in the social sciences including experimental, survey, qualitative, ethnographic, and interpretive methods.

In order to accomplish this, students will read academic texts about games (both primary and secondary), play selected game titles, write expository and persuasive text about their gameplay and important issues related to it, and participate actively in lecture and discussion. This class is open to everyone, from students who have never before a game to enthusiasts and game design majors.

|--- |--- |
|**Gameplay**|0%|
|**Engaged Readings**|15%|
|**Homework Assignments**|30%|
|**Unit Assignments**|40%|
|**Peer Evaluation of Group Work Contribution**|15%|

**Gameplay:** 
Each two-week unit focuses on a different game title, which you will be expected to play throughout the unit. We will not grade your gameplay but we will grade your assignments which are based on it, so we expect you to keep pace with class each unit and play (not merely watch) the games assigned.

**Engaged Reading:**
Each class, you will actively and collaboratively read and annotate assigned articles in Perusall, which is linked directly to the Canvas site. The quality, quantity, and timeliness of your text annotations and peer comments will be reviewed and graded.

**Homework Assignments:**
Each week you will complete an individual homework assignment that connects ideas from the lectures and readings to the game played. Detailed instructions and a grading rubric for each homework assignment is available on Canvas.

**Unit Assignments:**
As part of each unit, you will complete a group project demonstrating your understanding of the unit’s course content. Detailed instructions and a grading rubric for each unit assignment will be made available on Canvas.

**Peer Evaluation of Group Work Contribution:**
As part of each unit assignment, your group member peers will evaluate your individual contribution, communication, and attitude; such peer evaluations will contribute to your final grade. Detailed instructions and the peer grading rubric can be found on Canvas.

# ACADEMIC HONESTY

Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is academic fraud. You plagiarize when, without proper attribution, you do any of the following: copy verbatim from a book, an article, or other media; download documents from the Internet; purchase documents; report from other’s oral work; paraphrase or restate someone else’s facts, analysis, and/or conclusions; or copy directly from a classmate or allow a classmate to copy from you. If you are in doubt about what lies within the bounds of honest work, come see me before turning in your assignment. Any instances of academic dishonesty will result in an F for the course and a letter that will go into your academic file at UCI.

# INCLUSIVE CLASSROOM POLICY

As your instructors, we are committed to ensuring equality and valuing diversity throughout our course. Our individual differences can deepen our understanding of one another and the world around us, rather than divide us. In this class, people of all ethnicities, genders and gender identities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities are strongly encouraged to share their rich array of perspectives and experiences. If you feel your differences may in some way isolate you from UCI’s community or if you have a need for any specific accommodations, please speak with us early in the quarter about your concerns and what we can do together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class and community. For some of you, the following resources may be helpful:

# LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This UC Irvine campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Acjachemen and Tongva peoples, including 86 sacred sites and burial grounds. Both tribes continue to act as stewards of their ancestral lands as they have for over 8000 years. Settler colonialism is not a historical event but a current, ongoing process of thievery and extermination that indigenous people continue to resist to this very day.

# BASIC NEEDS SECURITY

Any student who faces challenges securing sufficient food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of StudentsLinks to an external site. for support (949-824-5181). Also note the following UCI resources:
